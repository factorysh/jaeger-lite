Jaeger-lite
===========

POCing [jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) (and [opentracing](http://opentracing.io/)), without [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

Main target are traefik traces.

TL;DR
-----

Jaeger is one implementation of tracing.
Tracing can be seen as light logging, with typed tags, timestamp and parent reference.
Tracing is non blocking, and can explain what happens in a request compound by services (parallelizeds or sequentials).
